# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model using Linear Regression to analyze factors influencing a target variable, such as life expectancy. It provides a comprehensive workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model building and evaluation. Key features include data imputation, feature selection, model fitting, and predictive analysis based on user input.

## Project Workflow
### Setting Up Environment
The environment setup involves importing necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.

### Loading and Preprocessing Data
- **Loading Dataset:** Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Imputes missing values using forward fill and median imputation for categorical and numerical variables, respectively.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Utilizes label encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical values.

### Feature Selection
- **Correlation Analysis:** Visualizes correlations between features and the target variable to select the most relevant predictors.
- **Top Features:** Identifies and selects top features correlated with the target variable.

### Model Building
- **Linear Regression Model:** Constructs and trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like R-squared score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Diagnostic Plots:** Generates diagnostic plots such as Actual vs Predicted values, Residuals vs Predicted values, and Histogram of Residuals to validate model assumptions.

### Predictions Based on User Input
- **Input Collection:** Collects user input features to predict the target variable.
- **Prediction:** Uses the trained model to predict the target variable based on user-provided input.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
- Statsmodels for advanced statistical analysis

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced regression techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression for regularization.
- Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse factors influencing life expectancy or other target variables.
